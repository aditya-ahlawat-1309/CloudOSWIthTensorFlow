        The cloud operating system is used for managing a cloud infrastructure.
        It hides the details of the cloud infrastructure from application
        programmers and helps to share the limited resources. It allows users to
        upload their files from any location in the cloud. This system also
        provides the facility of transferring the file from a single PC to large
        scale, distributed computer system.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Cloud OS designed to provide a configurable interface for developing
        and deploying massively scalable distributed applications on behalf of a
        large number of users, exploiting the seemingly inÔ¨Ånite CPU, storage,
        and bandwidth provided by the Cloud infrastructure.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Cloud operating system provides the extensive features of modern
        operating systems like Unix and it's successors. It also provides simple
        programming abstractions and strong isolation techniques between users
        and applications, we give importance to provide a much stronger level of
        integration with network resources.
